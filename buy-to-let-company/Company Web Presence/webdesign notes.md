Hi, I need a wordpress website created for a DevOps IT contracting site and was wondering whether you could help?

The company is called stablecaps. I am currently in the process of havinga logo designed. It should be ready in the next week or so. I would need the logo incorporated into the website.

tagline: Devops Gurus Specialising in Automation, Stability, Performance, and Infrastructure as Code

The brand key words (so far) are as follows:

1. Stable/reliable
2. Automation
3. DevOps specialist
4. Monitoring
5. Performance
6. infrastructure as code
7. software engineering
8. software release process
9. scalable software architecture
10. over a  decade  and a half of experience

I need the following:
1. A responsive web page
2. I have paid for avada, so website should be built with this
3. The website should have a dark & light theme
4. A unique & stylish home page that illustartes the key point sas to why someone should hire us.
5. I have several small case studies written as examples of the companies work which will have to be linked to
6. A "contact us for a consultaion" form page. This simple contact page shoudl be clearly accesible from any page if a prospective client is even thinking of hiring us. This page will have our address & contact details
7. No social media links are required
8. A Content Curation page of DevOps articles & blogs via [WP RSS Aggregator](https://www.wprssaggregator.com/case-study-personal-finance-blogs-content-curation/)
9. GDPR privacy page. Also need accept cookies stuff.
10. Note that I already have hosting and have wordpress installed with the Avada theme

Background:

3. https://riversafe.co.uk/

some devops stock images (note that they are obviously heavily overused, so don't lean too heavily on them)
