## Danger!!!

1. Mortgage costs can rise due to inflation and Bank of England rate hikes.
2. If you buy a buy to let and houses fall in the near term, you may end up in negative equity and lose money if you are forced to sell the property because you cannot pay the mortgage costs. 
3. However, If you can hold on to the property for a longer period of time, it is likely that property prices will recover. Thus, it may be worth it to take rental insurance to cover periods of time when the property might be vacant.
4. If youâ€™re putting down a large deposit then this reduces the chance of your ending up in negative equity.
