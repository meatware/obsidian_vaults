## **What is negative equity?**

Negative equity is when the value of your home is worth less than the amount you have still to pay on your mortgage. 

For example, you [bought a house](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/money-mentor/buying-home/) for £300,000 with a deposit of 5% (£15,000), meaning the bank advanced you a £285,000 loan.

If a year later, the value of your property dropped 10% to £270,000 you would be in negative equity.

It sounds bad, but negative equity is only really an immediate problem if you:

-   Are looking to sell your home now
-   Want to [remortgage](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/money-mentor/article/guide-remortgaging/) with a new lender
-   Have got so far behind with the mortgage payments that the lender repossesses your property. It then has to sell it quickly for less than what you originally paid for it, which means you would still be in debt.

If you are wanting to understand more about the [different types of mortgages available](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/money-mentor/article/different-types-mortgage/) and which is right for you, then check out our article.

## **What happens to my mortgage if house prices fall?**

Experts predict that [house prices will fall](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/money-mentor/article/will-house-prices-drop/) between 5-10% due to the soaring cost of living combined with rising interest rates making mortgage repayments more expensive.

What will happen to your mortgage, if house prices do fall by that amount, will depend on the type of deal that you are on.

-   **Part way through a [fixed-rate mortgage deal](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/money-mentor/article/different-types-mortgage/) –** Both you and your borrower commit to set repayments typically for a period of two, three or five years. Falling house prices will have no impact on your finances until you come to the end of your deal and need to look for a new one. You will continue with the same monthly mortgage payments.

-   **Still on a tracker deal –** A tracker mortgage follows movements in the Bank of England base rate. The cost of your mortgage might go up or down during the term of the deal. Right now, it will be increasing as interest rates are going up.

-   **On a lender’s discounted variable-rate deal –** This can change at any time at the lender’s discretion, so your mortgage may go up or down.

Remember: the value of your property won’t itself be an issue as long as you can afford to keep up the repayments should rates rise.

## **How do I know if I am in negative equity?**

If you want to get an idea of how much your property is worth and how much equity you have in it, you could ask a local estate agent to value your home. Or you could use a property search website to compare prices in your area.

To find out how much you owe on your mortgage, contact your lender or check your online account.

However, if you are happy living where you are and you can keep up with the current monthly repayments, you don’t have to do anything.

It is likely you will be out of negative equity at some point in the future. 

### **Remortgaging while in negative equity**

Where you could face difficulties is when your current fixed deal expires and you come to look for a new mortgage if you are in negative equity.

Lenders typically won’t take on new customers in this situation.

### **Selling a home while in negative equity**

Selling your house while in negative equity should not be taken lightly. It should only be considered in urgent cases or if you are in severe financial difficulty. First check if there is any other alternative open to you.

Usually, the best thing to do is keep up with your monthly mortgage payments, if you are able, and wait for the market to recover. 

When the value of the property resumes its ascent, or when you have paid enough off the mortgage and you get back into positive equity, it can be a better time to look at selling again.

You could explore the option of moving while renting out your existing property until the market has recovered. 

You could also contact your mortgage lender to see if there is anything that can be done.

### **Moving while in negative equity**

If you urgently need to sell or move home but the sale price is not enough to repay the mortgage then you will need your lender’s permission to proceed. They may allow you to sell your home and repay the shortfall over time.

A few lenders will give you the option to transfer the negative equity to another property but this is not common and you will likely need an excellent payment record. 

You could also allow your home to be repossessed or declare bankruptcy. But both these options should be a last resort, as you will get even less from the sale of the property and will end up owing more to your lender.

Your [credit score](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/money-mentor/article/credit-scores/) will also be damaged for a number of years and you will face other significant financial complications. 

## **Reducing the risk of negative equity**

One of the best ways to reduce the risk of negative equity is to put down a bigger deposit so you are borrowing less [through a mortgage](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/money-mentor/article/different-types-mortgage/). You could aim for above 10% to 15% of the property’s purchase price.

If house prices fall, the chance of your property’s valuation falling below the balance on your mortgage is reduced. 

Also thoroughly research the area where you are planning to buy to check that you are not overpaying for a property.

Remember though that it can be difficult to calculate a property’s true value as the price is determined by how much people are willing to pay for it.

Overall, the UK property market has been growing since the aftermath of the financial crisis, and at some pace since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic.

## **How to get out of negative equity**

If you are in negative equity, typically the best thing to do is keep up with your monthly mortgage payments and hope the property market recovers in time. 

If you are on a repayment mortgage, the amount you still owe your lender will continue to fall. And at some point you will be out of negative equity even if the wider market hasn’t recovered.

You could also use savings to pay off some of the mortgage, so reducing the size of your loan.

Most lenders allow you to pay an extra 10% of your mortgage each year without imposing an early repayment charges.
