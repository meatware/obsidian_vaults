## 1. Saved Money
What you saved, beg borrow or steal.


## 2. Bridging loan (short-term not so useful)

[[What are bridging loans and how do they work 1?]]

## 3. Remortgaging existing property on when you know you’ll have your funds available (for example when the sale of your house has gone through). This type of loan is usually cheaper than an open bridging loan because there is less flexibility available around rety (switching morgate?properased)

#### Can you release equity without remortgaging?

Unfortunately you can't. If you're wanting to unlock some of the funds that are tied up in your home, equity release could be another alternative to remortgaging. 

Equity release allows homeowners aged 55-95 to access a portion of their property's value. After any existing mortgage has been settled, the tax-free money released is then yours to spend in a variety of ways. Why not use our equity release calculator to [see how much you could release](https://www.keyadvice.co.uk/equity-release/calculator).  
  
With our [lifetime mortgage](https://www.keyadvice.co.uk/equity-release/lifetime-mortgages) plans, the most popular form of equity release, you retain full ownership of your property. So, you’ll be able to enjoy the funds you’ve released and your home, without the stress of moving.  
  
That's because it's a loan secured against your home and it's usually repaid after your property is sold when your plan comes to an end. That's typically when you or the last remaining applicant either passes away or enters into long-term care.  
  
Just like remortgaging, equity release isn’t for everyone, so it’s important to consider all of your options. You have to seek advice before going ahead. Remember that equity release will reduce the value of your estate, and the amount you’re able to leave as an inheritance. At Key, we offer a number of personalised extras such as our no negative equity guarantee that will give you added peace of mind.

#### Can you afford equity release?

There are typically no monthly repayments associated with lifetime mortgages, the most popular form of equity release. If you wish, you may be able to pay off the interest as you go by taking out a plan which allows you to make either regular or ad hoc repayments, but it's not compulsory.

Things to consider before taking out equity release

-   You have to get advice before releasing tax-free funds from your home - please read all our information and [make sure it’s right for you](https://www.keyadvice.co.uk/equity-release/is-it-right-for-me)
-   Key Equity Release offer lifetime mortgages only, which is a loan secured against your home. It will reduce the value of your estate and may affect your entitlement to means-tested benefits
-   All of our plans meet the Equity Release Council standards and come with several protections, including the no negative equity guarantee, which means you’ll never owe more than your home’s value
-   You should always think carefully before securing a loan against your property

## Secured loan
These loans use an asset, such as your home, as collateral – meaning you could lose the asset if you can't keep up with repayments. But a secured loan can still be suitable if you're confident you can stick to the payment schedule. Collateral lowers risk for the lender, so you may be able to get better rates or higher amounts with a secured loan – even if your credit score's low.

## Guarantor loans

These loans require you to have a guarantor: someone who promises to repay the loan if you can't. This is usually an older relative or friend, although it can be almost anyone who meets the lender's criteria. These loans carry risk for both the guarantor and borrower – but if you have a low credit score, using a guarantor can improve your chances of acceptance.
