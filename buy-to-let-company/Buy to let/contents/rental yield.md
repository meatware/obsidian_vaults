Here's how to work out rental yield:

1. Take the expected monthly rental income and multiply by 12. This is your annual rental income.

2. Divide the annual rental income figure by the price of the property.

3. Multiply this figure by 100. The result is your rental yield percentage.

## Rent to students = 3 bed house
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
assume rent is £350/month
= £4200/year

Total rent * 3 rooms = £12,600

£200,000 house = 6.3% yield

£175,000 house = 7.2% yield

£150,000 house = 8.4% yield
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## Rent to students = 4 bed house

A 4 bed would proobably be better. You also considser whether you want to rent the
property as a tenancy with multiple signeed on the lease or have a "House of Multiple Occupancy" (HMO)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
assume rent is £350/month
= £4200/year

Total rent * 4 rooms = £16,800

£200,000 house = 8.4% yield

£175,000 house = 9.6% yield

£150,000 house = 11.2% yield

But note that you will obviously have to pay more for a 4 bed. Unless you get a steal at auction or repossession
