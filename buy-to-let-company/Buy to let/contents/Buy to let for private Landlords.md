## Is a buy to let still worth it in 2023?


Changes to mortgage interest relief and a surcharge on stamp duty for second homes has made many [landlords-to-be](https://www.unbiased.co.uk/discover/mortgages-property/buy-to-let-renting/being-a-landlord) ask the question: ‘Is buy-to-let still worth it?’

Property price growth has slowed in recent years, making buying to let more risky than it has been in the past.

Furthermore, the government has clamped down on the [buy-to-let](https://www.unbiased.co.uk/discover/mortgages-property/buy-to-let-renting/buy-to-let-guide) market in recent years with changes to the tax system. Firstly, in 2016 it added a [3% surcharge in stamp duty](https://www.unbiased.co.uk/discover/mortgages-property/buy-to-let-renting/do-i-need-to-pay-additional-buy-to-let-stamp-duty) on additional properties, such as second homes and buy-to-let properties.

Secondly, since 2017 the government has been [reducing mortgage interest relief](https://www.unbiased.co.uk/news/financial-adviser/three-ways-to-cope-with-losing-buy-to-let-tax-relief). The previous scheme enabled landlords to deduct the interest they pay on their mortgage before paying tax.

This effectively gave higher-rate taxpayers 40% tax relief on their mortgage payments. Now, landlords will be given a flat-rate tax credit based on 20% of their mortgage interest.

This won’t have a negative impact on most landlords who were already basic-rate taxpayers, but will mostly affect those who are higher or top-rate taxpayers.

This apparent income rise could push some up from the basic rate to the higher rate, which would mean a higher tax bill.


### Advantages of buy-to-let

-   You’ll earn rental income (though [possibly less than in previous years](https://www.unbiased.co.uk/discover/mortgages-property/buy-to-let-renting/what-does-the-future-hold-for-buy-to-let)). In some areas of the UK, such as Liverpool, Glasgow and Leicester, rental yield is as high as 8%, while other areas are around the 3% mark.
-   At the same time, you could generate capital growth as your money grows as your property value increases.
-   You can [take out insurance](https://www.unbiased.co.uk/discover/mortgages-property/buy-to-let-renting/do-i-need-buy-to-let-landlord-insurance) to cover against loss of rental income, damage and legal costs.

### Disadvantages of buy-to-let

-   Your tax bill will be higher than it once was, eating into your profits.
-   If you don’t have the right insurance in place, you might not generate an income if the property is unoccupied.
-   If property prices fall, your capital will reduce. And if you have an interest-only mortgage, you’ll need to make up for any shortfall if the property sells for less than you bought it for.
-   You’ll need to factor in the costs of stamp duty, insurance and wear & tear.
-   Being a landlord is a big responsibility. [Check out our tips](https://www.unbiased.co.uk/discover/mortgages-property/buy-to-let-renting/being-a-landlord) before deciding.

#### What are the implications of the Capital Gains Tax changes?

There have been recent tweaks to Capital Gains Tax. This means that buy-to-let investors also face a heftier tax bill on profits when they sell up. The Capital Gains Tax rate on residential property is 28% for higher rate taxpayers and 18% for basic rate taxpayers versus 18% and 10% on other assets. It’s worth noting that as part of the recent Autumn Statement, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt confirmed that the tax-free allowance for capital gains tax will be reduced from the current rate of £12,300 to £6,000 in April 2023. It will then be reduced further the following year from £6,000 to £3,000. This lower tax-free allowance means landlords will have to pay more capital gains tax when they sell a property in the coming years.

#### Should you set up a limited company?

One of the big questions you might want to ask yourself, if you’re thinking of becoming a landlord in 2023, is whether or not to purchase your buy-to-let through a limited company. If you’re in the higher tax bracket, you could be paying 40% tax on your income if your property is set up in your personal name. For this reason, **Ranjan** **Bhattacharya** – an investor and property mogul with over 35 years experience in the industry – is convinced that landlords should look to set up a limited company. This means you’ll pay the lower corporation tax – which currently sits at 19%. This is likely to rise to 25% in 2023 which will affect your profits again.

It's worth mentioning that the number of buy-to-let mortgages on offer for limited companies tends to be lower than for private individuals. You may find it more difficult to arrange a mortgage, and you'll also have to file annual accounts – which is done by an accountant – and this can also be pretty costly.
