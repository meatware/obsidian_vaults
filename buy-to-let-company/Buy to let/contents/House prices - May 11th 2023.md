## **What’s happening to house prices?**

The housing market still has some momentum and prices have climbed over the past year. But surging [mortgage rates](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/money-mentor/mortgage-comparison/) and the [cost of living crisis](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/money-mentor/article/cost-of-living-crisis/) have hit household budgets. And the rate of property price growth is now stalling, even falling.

According to Zoopla, the number of new property sales agreed fell by 16% in the year to March 2023, but remained 11% higher than 2019 levels and were on an upwards trajectory.

Property website Rightmove found that the market had cooled somewhat, with annual house price growth falling from 3% in the year to March to 1.2% in the 12 months to April. However, it reported that asking prices for first-time buyers still managed to hit a record high of £224,963, up 2% in the year to April.

Once a month, Nationwide, Halifax, Rightmove and the Office for National Statistics (ONS) publish figures on average house prices. We outline the latest figures in the table below.

House price figures

How the figures are calculated

Halifax

Its most recent figures showed that house prices went up 0.1% in the year to April, though the pace of growth has slowed from 1.6%. Looking at monthly figures, prices fell 0.3% between March and April, taking the average UK house price to £286,896

Halifax uses data of house purchase transactions it has financed to measure market changes

Nationwide

Its figures for April put the average house price at £260,441, a 2.7% fall over the year. Prices rose 0.5% from March’s level, following seven consecutive monthly falls

Nationwide uses data from mortgages it has approved to generate the cost of a typical house

Rightmove

Average asking prices reached £366,247 in April, a 0.2% rise from the month before. Over the year it said house prices had gone up 1.2%

Rightmove uses house prices agreed at the point when a mortgage is granted for properties listed on its website to provide its house price index. It has a much larger sample size than both Halifax and Nationwide

The ONS

It recorded a 6.3% jump in house prices in the year to January 2023, but a 1.1% fall from the previous month’s level

The ONS uses data from the Land Registry to record changes in the property market

### What is causing house prices to fall?

House prices are now falling because of the squeeze on household finances. This has been caused mainly by the cost of living crisis and rising mortgage rates.

On 11 May, the [Bank of England raised the base rate to 4.5%](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/money-mentor/article/interest-rates-rise/?2). This is the highest it has been since 2008. Analysts predict that the base rate could reach between 4.75% and 5% this year.

For someone taking out a two-year fixed-rate mortgage with a 10% deposit, average interest rates are around 6%. On a £200,000 mortgage this means that monthly repayments would be a whopping £1,290. That’s 50% higher than November 2021 when you would be paying closer to £900 a month.

Rising rates make it more expensive to borrow money which means fewer potential buyers can afford mortgages. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) predicts that house prices will fall 9% over the next two years. They predict they will rise again in 2025.

In March, mortgage approvals increased to 52,000 from 43,500 February, according to the Bank of England. However, the amount of money being lent out fell to its lowest level since 2011 (excluding the pandemic).

There were 76,920 house sales in February, 18% lower compared to the same month in 2022, according to HMRC. The [mortgage chaos](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/money-mentor/article/remortgage/) caused by the 23 September mini-budget has had a knock-on effect on property sales.

Before house prices started falling at the end of 2022, the market had defied the odds. It didn’t just survive but positively thrived. This was caused mainly by pandemic-related factors such as:

-   Pent up demand
-   Desire for more space and rural living
-   [Low mortgage rates](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/money-mentor/article/1-percent-mortgage-rates/)
-   The [stamp duty holiday](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/money-mentor/article/stamp-duty-holiday-extended/) (which ended in October 2021)

House prices had continued to grow since Covid restrictions ended, with unemployment remaining low and demand for properties outweighing supply. But it is now starting to stall.

Mortgage payments remain most affordable for those with a large deposit. This isn’t great news for first-time buyers who tend to have small downpayments.

Nationwide said a 10% deposit is now more than 50% of a typical first-time buyer’s annual income.

## **Will house prices crash in 2023?**

Figures show that house prices are starting to fall. This decline is expected to continue in 2023.

There are a number of reasons for this:

-   [Interest rates have increased](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/money-mentor/article/interest-rates-rise/) from their record lows since the end of 2021. This has made mortgages more expensive and reduced demand in the housing market
-   Following the government’s [September mini-budget](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/money-mentor/article/mini-budget-glance/), the Bank of England warned it won’t hesitate to increase interest rates further to rein in high inflation.
-   A number of lenders withdrew [mortgage deals](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/money-mentor/mortgage-property/mortgages/) after the mini-budget, reducing the availability of home loans
-   We are in a cost of living crisis as [inflation is rising](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/money-mentor/article/rpi-versus-cpi/). This makes goods and services more expensive compared to a year ago. Over-stretched budgets mean fewer people will be able to save enough to buy
-   Rising costs, especially energy bills, could mean that some people struggle to make their mortgage repayments. This could lead them to sell up. If that happens then an increased supply of properties coming onto the market could combine with waning demand to force down prices.
-   House prices rose extremely fast during 2021 and could “correct” by falling just as quickly. This could happen if interest rates keep rising and the availability of cheap mortgage deals become still more elusive

As time goes on, rising interest rates could hit the housing market by making it:

-   More expensive to borrow money
-   Harder to find a cheap mortgage deal

If there are fewer cheap loans available, there might be less demand for houses, causing a possible house price correction.

## **Should I buy a house now or wait?**

Some people, especially first time buyers, will be hoping for house prices to fall further to make it more affordable to buy.

Interest rates, which are already at their highest level since 2008, are expected to continue to go up as the Bank of England tries to get a handle on [soaring inflation](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/money-mentor/article/inflation-means-for-your-money/).

With borrowing becoming more expensive, buyer demand is starting to fall.

While you might save money on the purchase price of a house, rising mortgage costs could actually cancel out any savings.

And now that we face a prolonged [recession](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/money-mentor/article/recession-proof-finances/), the number of sellers could drop again too as people become more risk-averse.

There are already indications of homeowners putting off their next move. This is partly because of a shortage of available properties to buy. But it’s also because they are questioning whether their finances would be able to cope with the costs. 

While the property market was resilient during the pandemic, there are now signs it’s slowing down in the face of rising costs.

If you are looking to buy soon, another consideration is what would happen should there be a dramatic drop in house prices, as is expected over the next two years. Could a fall wipe out the value of your deposit and leave you in [negative equity](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/money-mentor/article/negative-equity/)?

Whether it’s a good idea to buy or hold off will depend on your own circumstances, so you need to weigh up the pros and cons carefully. In the next section we help you decide whether it’s worth delaying your house purchase.

If you are confident that you would be able to keep up the mortgage repayments, buying now might make sense. This is particularly true if you plan to live in that property for some time, rather than treating it as an investment, in which case you would be at the mercy of a market in which prices may not recover in the short term.

## Should first-time buyers delay buying a house?

If you are looking to buy your first home but worried about mortgage rates and house prices, here are the arguments for and against buying a home in the current market.

### Yes to delaying your house purchase

-   Mortgage rates have increased over the past year so it is more expensive to borrow money to buy
-   The consensus is that house prices will fall over the next two years, so anyone who buys now risks seeing the value of their first home plummet
-   If you’ve only put down a small deposit and house prices fall, you could end up in [negative equity](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/money-mentor/article/negative-equity/). Though this would only be an issue if you wanted to sell your home
-   Should the predictions come true and house prices continue to fall, by holding off you may not need such a big mortgage loan and the minimum deposit by the lender required may be smaller too
-   If you have the option to live with family without paying rent, you might be able to save a larger deposit. This would increase the equity in your home when you do come to buy and make you eligible for a cheaper mortgage deal. 

### No to delaying your house purchase

-   Owning a home means you don’t have to worry about your landlord hiking your rent or suddenly giving you notice to move out of your home
-   Moving out of a rental property means you would be paying off your own mortgage, rather than someone else’s
-   While there are plenty of predictions about house prices, we can’t know for certain how much they will fall by, so you could be waiting for a long time for them to hit rock-bottom
-   House prices will likely take a substantial hit, but another downside of waiting is that this might come at the expense of being able to secure a cheaper mortgage
-   If you think you will want to stay in your home for at least three years then you could ride out the suspected downturn in house prices
-   If you’re putting down a large deposit then this reduces the chance of your ending up in negative equity
-   Now could be a good time to find a bargain; if a seller wants a quick sale before rates peak next year then you might find that being a first-time buyer gives you a greater advantage as you have no chain to hold up the process

## **Is it cheaper to rent or buy a house?**

In the past, it was usual to rent a home to save money in order to put towards buying a place of your own. But rising rental prices, particularly in big cities, have made it very difficult for first-time buyers to save.

During 2022, rental prices reached record highs, though they finally started slowing in December.

According to the latest figures from the Homelet rental index:

-   The average monthly rent in the UK was £1,184 in March after increasing 0.8% from February. That’s an increase of 9.8% over the year.
-   If you take London out of the equation, the average rent in the UK is now £993 a month, up by 1% from February
-   Every region in the UK saw an increase for both monthly and annual figures
-   Average rents in the north east of England increased the most, rising by 1.6% in a month

According to the latest data from the ONS, private rental prices have increased at their greatest annual rate for more than five years, as demand continues to heavily outweigh supply.

Mortgages are also getting more expensive because of [rising interest rates](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/money-mentor/article/interest-rates-rise/). We outline the average mortgage rates. Also get a rough idea of what you would pay a month with [our mortgage repayment calculator.](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/money-mentor/article/mortgage-repayments-calculator/)

However, mortgage rates could still be lower than the cost of monthly rent.

Yet affordability is still a big problem for many first-time buyers, with the average property costing 9.1 times the average person’s salary. In 1997 properties cost just 3.5 times average earnings.

That can make it even harder for tenants to save enough for a house deposit when the payments to their landlord are so high, leaving them stuck in rental properties until they can set enough money aside.

Our guide to whether you [should buy or rent a house](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/money-mentor/article/rent-buy-which-best/) weighs up the pros and cons.

## **What will happen to mortgage rates?**

In an attempt to combat soaring inflation, the Bank of England increased the base rate to 4.5% on 11 May.

This was the twelfth consecutive rate rise since December 2021, and it is already making home loans much more expensive.

The Bank of England’s base rate is expected to peak at as high as 5% in 2023. So mortgage rates are likely to go up this year.

If you are coming off a fixed-rate mortgage deal soon and looking for a new one, you will likely struggle to find a deal as good as you are on now; so expect your monthly repayments to increase.

Variable rate mortgages, which make up about a fifth of home loans, are directly linked to changes in the base rate so customers will immediately see a rise in their bills.
