# Overview

A director’s loan is when you (or other close family members) get money from your company that is not:

-   a salary, dividend or expense repayment
-   money you’ve previously paid into or loaned the company

## Records you must keep

You must keep a record of any money you borrow from or pay into the company - this record is usually known as a ‘director’s loan account’.

### At the end of your company’s financial year

Include any money you owe the company or the company owes you on the [‘balance sheet’ in your annual accounts](https://www.gov.uk/prepare-file-annual-accounts-for-limited-company/prepare-annual-accounts).

## Tax on loans

You may have to pay tax on director’s loans. Your company may also have to pay tax if you’re a shareholder (sometimes called a ‘participator’) as well as a director.

Your personal and company tax responsibilities depend on whether the director’s loan account is:

-   overdrawn - [you owe the company](https://www.gov.uk/directors-loans/you-owe-your-company-money)
-   in credit - [the company owes you](https://www.gov.uk/directors-loans/you-lend-your-company-money)
